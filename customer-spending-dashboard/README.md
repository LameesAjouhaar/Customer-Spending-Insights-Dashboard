# API Mocking

This project uses a local mockData.json file instead of a live backend.

API calls:

dashboardApi.ts

Return data directly from:

mockData.json

This allows:

Real axios calls

Real async behaviour

Real data typing

No backend required

# Future Improvements

If extended further, the project could include:

Real backend integration

Authentication

Date filters

API pagination for transactions

Live data refresh

Dark mode toggle

Export to PDF / CSV
